The team's main area of focus is the flagship VisualEditor, our industry-leading rich-text editing platform which we have been extending to serve new use cases (e.g. DiscussionTools to support on-wiki communication) and unlock new capabilities that lower the barriers people encounter when contributing to Wikipedia.

Experience with object-oriented development using a scripting language (such as JavaScript, PHP, Python or Ruby). Most of our work is in JavaScript, PHP and CSS.
Focused software engineering: you have experience of writing unit tests, and of structuring your work with version control.
Strong written communication skills as our collaboration largely happens online, on chats, wikis, documents and tickets.
Qualities that are important to us:
A desire to make meaningful contributions to knowledge equity, free culture, and open access.
An emphasis on communicating clearly in both synchronous and asynchronous channels.A strong aptitude in algorithms and data structures is essential!
A desire to write well-documented and maintainable code.
The willingness to participate in technical discussions, proposing solutions to technical challenges, participating in code reviews and receiving feedback.
An eagerness and curiosity to solve technical problems, trying things out and investigating issues, and supporting the work of others.
Additionally, we'd love it if you have this:
Experience building a rich-text editor.
Experience working with large, legacy codebases.
A history of editing on Wikimedia projects.
A history of open-source contribution.
Bachelor's degree in computer science or mathematics, or equivalent experience.

The Wikimedia Foundation is a charitable, not-for-profit organization that relies on donations. We receive donations from millions of individuals around the world, with an average donation of about $15. We also receive donations through institutional grants and gifts.

Digital BDM role:
You’ll have a good grasp of the tech / digital sector, and will enjoy working with potential clients to analyse their needs, and formulate and articulate development solutions that can help solve their real-world challenges, or enable them to realise new opportunities.
The role combines direct pre-sale client engagement, proposal writing and presenting, and producing marketing and sales material that will help generate new leads. As such, we’re looking for a strategist, an exceptional communicator and a confident writer, who can orchestrate campaigns that resonate with our clients and markets.
You’ll need to identify new business opportunities and build relationships with potential and established clients. You’ll be responsible for both outbound and inbound business generation through proactive targeting of future clients, whilst growing leads that come into the business.
You'll be discussing project ideas with clients ranging from large multinationals to ambitious SMEs, so it's important that you talk with confidence and enthusiasm about creative, and often technically complex digital projects, and that you can guide them towards solutions that best fit their needs.
You’ll have great ideas, a flexible and proactive attitude and an innate understanding of what makes a great digital project. You'll understand digital and what opportunities this exciting medium provides for our clients. You'll know how to communicate the agencies strengths and services, with a sales and marketing strategy that enables us to stand out from the crowd in an increasingly competitive market.
Larger projects often require us to go through tendering processes. Therefore, in addition to the above, we’re seeking someone who understands how to successfully undertake tender evaluation and bid writing (including public sector procurement) – i.e. being able to analyse requirements, identify solutions that align to assessment matrices, and create persuasive and appropriate content that help our bids stand out and resonate with the buyer.

Experience required:
Proven/successful business development experience, ideally in the tech/digital sector
Strong understanding of digital solutions with the ability to articulate value to diverse audiences
Excellent written skills with the ability to write captivating proposals and tender responses
Self-organisational skills including the ability to successfully balance many different projects and priorities

This is your chance to be a part of that, as a Technical Author at Canonical.
We are building documentation capacity at scale. We have dozens of positions available, for teams and products across the organisation, at all levels from Graduate to Senior Staff.
All applications and candidates are handled through this one entry-point.
These are not traditional technical writer roles. As a Technical Author, you will lead the documentation efforts of a Canonical team, in engineering, business operations or another part of the company.

In this role you'll take a responsive approach to software documentation problems and develop a strong understanding of how products work together and are used in the real world.
An operations-focused Technical Author is part of a business team, for example Legal, HR or Talent. An important part of this work is to maintain internal documentation, such as employee handbooks. In this role you will help develop and improve materials that hundreds of colleagues rely on daily, and define patterns of business communication for a rapidly-growing organisation.
You'll have a chance to tell us your preferred focus, and we'll work with you to find the right seniority level and team for you.
Whatever your focus, you will also be a part of Canonical's documentation practice team, that includes all the company's Technical Authors. Here, you'll be amongst other documentation experts, who collaborate to define documentation excellence and drive the development of documentation practice and theory, across the company and in the open-source software community.

Would you like to join a team of dedicated usability researchers, who produce cutting-edge User Experience research? Producing UX research findings that will be used by thousands of web professionals, including some of the biggest brands in the world (including Amazon, Google, Nike, Shopify)? Are you excellent at presenting complex research findings on web user behavior through the written word?
Then apply for the remote full-time position as UX Research Analyst & Writer at Baymard Institute.
About Your Job at Baymard
In this position, you will join Baymard’s team of usability researchers and primarily work at annotating and analyzing our raw usability test data and writing the insights from this into usability guidelines. The guidelines go directly into our Baymard subscription platform (https://baymard.com/research).
Our Baymard customers are eagerly waiting for your UX research insights, be it the UI designer at Nike or the ecommerce director at Amazon, as they use it as direct input for their UX and UI design decisions.
In this role, you’ll need to enjoy analysis and writing, since analyzing usability test data and writing usability test findings will be at least 50–80% of what you’ll be doing all year round.
Besides analysis and writing, the job also involves moderating 1-1 usability tests and identifying themes and issues across multiple sites, and coming up with proposals for design patterns that can alleviate the identified problems.
While each researcher at Baymard generally directs their own study, from research design through publication, collaboration with other team members is an essential part of the job. As such, the amount of input and control you have over any one phase of research varies based on the specific research being conducted, other team members’ availability, and your own strengths when it comes to the many phases that comprise a complete research study.
In this job, you’ll be directly shaping the future of ecommerce, become a published usability research author, and should expect to join the ranks of the absolute top experts within ecommerce usability within a few years (if you aren’t already).
We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people and, therefore, the position is fully remote. All of Baymard's current research team is already working remotely, and the entire company is structured around remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from locations such as UK, Ireland, EU, Canada, or US.
For more information about Baymard as a company, see this “Key Work Values” section (https://baymard.com/jobs/research-writer#key-work-values-at-baymard).
Job Qualifications
While we will train you in Baymard’s methodology and analysis process, we expect that you have the following qualifications. The numbers in brackets indicate the weighted importance of each on a 7-point scale (higher = more important). These weights reflect how candidates are evaluated, so make sure your application illustrates your prowess in the highest-weighted skills and traits.
[7/7] Substantial experience with analyzing usability test data. We take qualitative test data in the form of test session videos as the basis for our analysis, so experience in this form of analysis is preferred.
[7/7] Substantial experience with writing usability guidelines (or best practices, UX issues to avoid, etc.).
[7/7] A sincere desire to collaborate effectively with colleagues (e.g., by taking in and thoughtfully responding to feedback and editorial direction, supporting other researchers in their own projects, etc.)
[5/7] Broad experience with usability research (e.g., conducting think-aloud usability test sessions, analyzing data, writing findings).
[5/7] Ability to propose web design recommendations for the usability issues we identify.
We furthermore expect that you are comfortable working remotely via digital platforms. Additionally, as most of our team is either based in the eastern USA or western Europe, you must have at least 3–4 hours of daily scheduled work overlap with those timezones.
Practical Details
Experience level: at least 3–5 years of experience in UX research.
Salary: in accordance with qualifications and location.
Location: remote, full-time position from UK, Ireland, EU, Canada, or US.
Start date: as soon as possible.
Travel: limited; expect only 0-1 week of optional travel each year (in connection with an optional, company-wide meetup).
How to Apply
If you’re interested in this position, please send the following:
1. At least one long-form UX writing sample (1,000+ words), or a series of samples. While a writing sample on a UX topic is strongly preferred, we’ll also consider writing on other web-related topics (e.g., ecommerce, information architecture, documentation). Samples can be both published or unpublished works; all materials are kept confidential. (Note: slide decks and samples with multiple authors are not considered.) (Required)
2. A cover letter (1 page; PDF) describing how you fit the role and qualifications. (Required)
3. A resume (PDF) or a link to your LinkedIn profile. (Required)
Send the above to job+researcher25q2@baymard.com.
(All applications and materials are treated confidentially.)
Deadline is May 11th, 2025 (end of day).
Note: Based on the applications, a few selected candidates will be assigned a paid writing and analysis test, which will be the main evaluation criterion for the position. This will also be a good way for you to get a feel for the primary task of this job. (The test will be performed remotely. You’ll be given a real usability test dataset to analyze and describe within a 10-day deadline.)
Also, consider reading our SaaS sales page (https://baymard.com/research) and our “Key Work Values” section (https://baymard.com/jobs/research-writer#key-work-values-at-baymard).

Edward Scott, UX Research Lead at the Baymard Institute

You’ll learn how to gather requirements, map processes, and develop and maintain digital solutions that address real-world business problems.

You bring a problem-solving mindset and a willingness to ask questions, explore solutions, and work collaboratively. You’re confident using Microsoft Office and comfortable communicating with colleagues across different teams. Whether supporting a team meeting or testing a new digital tool, you bring a positive attitude and a readiness to grow.
You may have seen or used platforms like SharePoint or Salesforce, and you’re interested in how data and automation can make a difference in the real world.
Most importantly, you’re looking for a supportive environment where you can build a solid foundation in both technical and business skills—setting you up for a career in digital development and analysis.

Essential Qualifications
At least 7 GCSEs at grade A-C (grade 4) or above, including Maths and English.

Ecotricity is Britain's greenest energy company. When we started back in 1995, we were the first company in the world to provide a new kind of electricity - the green kind.
Our mission was, and remains, to change the way energy is made and used in Britain - by replacing fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy.
We don't just supply green energy, we use the money from our customers' bills to make it ourselves too - we build windmills, sun parks and green gasmills in Britain. We call this turning 'bills into mills'. Some of our biggest achievements to date include building Britain's first megawatt windmill and the country's first grid-scale sun park, as well as building our first green gasmill, generating 100% green gas from a source that we will never run out of grass.
We don't just focus on energy though- we built the Electric Highway, Britain's leading network of electric vehicle charging points; we helped Forest Green Rovers become the greenest football club in the world; and we launched Britain's greenest mobile phone service, Ecotalk, where they use the money from their customers' bills to protect and regenerate Britain's lost rainforests.
Ecotricity is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to providing equality for all.

The electricity grid is changing beyond recognition, and without deploying new software to orchestrate it, we’ll be unable to decarbonise.
At Axle, we’re building the infrastructure that’ll underpin the decarbonised energy system. Our software crushes CO2 and energy costs. Our goal is insanely ambitious, and we’re building a team to match the scale of this challenge. We’ve just raised a Seed round from world-leading investors including Accel (TechCrunch) and we’re growing fast.
We make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we’re growing quickly.
Axle is a unique startup. We’re building in a legacy industry and moving gigawatt-hours of electrons in the real world, but we operate at lightning speed. We ship extraordinarily quickly, and we’re experts in electricity systems. We’re backed by some of the best investors in the world, and we’re growing the team to meet customer demand.
Read more about what we’re building here.
Requirements
At Axle, we read data from hundreds of thousands of devices every day. We then optimize the performance of those devices, and participate in electricity markets with them. As our business grows, we're looking for a driven data analyst to help build reporting, monitoring, and visualization across the business.
Some things you might work on:
Visualizing the charging patterns of thousands of electric vehicles
Building dashboards to help us understand which devices are online
Tracking our financial performance vs our revenue targets
You’ll need:
Tech chops: you’ll need comfort with SQL and basic Python knowledge to work with and automate our data processes
Strong analytical skills: you’ll be speaking MW, kWh, and £ every day
Commercial instincts: we're looking for somebody who can help us spot opportunities lurking in our data!
A deep-seated motivation to combat climate change
Comfort moving fast in an uncertain and changeable environment
You can expect:
insane amounts of ownership
lots of fascinating data to get to grips with
the support of a world class engineering & commercial team

This role would suit an ambitious generalist with a strong analytical background. We don’t care if you’ve held a role with a similar title before: if you’ve got a track record of getting things done in complex, data-heavy environments, let’s chat.

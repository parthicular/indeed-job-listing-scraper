    "description": "Software Engineer III – Editing Team\nLocation: Candidates must be within the UTC-5 to UTC+1 time zones.\nCore Working Hours: 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM UTC - 6:00 PM UTC.\nSummary\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is looking for a software engineer to join our team, reporting to product engineering management. As a software engineer, you will be responsible for engineering software that supports our product user experiences. In this role, you will work in a distributed environment, where we value teamwork and a consensus-oriented approach. You get to write open source code for collaborative experiences supporting a worldwide top-ten website (over a half a billion pages accessed per day), and you get to do it at a place that believes we're all more successful when everyone has a good work-life balance.\nOn the Editing Team, we support new and experienced volunteers working in 300+ languages with the tools they need to keep Wikipedia accurate and up to date. The team's main area of focus is the flagship VisualEditor, our industry-leading rich-text editing platform which we have been extending to serve new use cases (e.g. DiscussionTools to support on-wiki communication) and unlock new capabilities that lower the barriers people encounter when contributing to Wikipedia. The latest capability being Edit Check, an open-ended system designed to surface actionable pieces of feedback and suggestions that help volunteers improve the quality and integrity of the information Wikipedia offers.\nYou are responsible for:\nImproving the Wikipedia product experience by fixing bugs and implementing new functionality.\nIterating on new features through collaboration with fellow engineers, product managers, designers, other teams, and community members.\nWriting multilingual, accessible, and performant code using Javascript and PHP.\nBuilding on top of the MediaWiki API ecosystem.\nInstrumenting components to monitor feature behavior and quality characteristics.\nSkills and experience:\n2–5 years related professional or open-source software engineering experience.\nExperience with object-oriented development using a scripting language (such as JavaScript, PHP, Python or Ruby). Most of our work is in JavaScript, PHP and CSS.\nFocused software engineering: you have experience of writing unit tests, and of structuring your work with version control.\nStrong written communication skills as our collaboration largely happens online, on chats, wikis, documents and tickets.\nQualities that are important to us:\nA desire to make meaningful contributions to knowledge equity, free culture, and open access.\nAn emphasis on communicating clearly in both synchronous and asynchronous channels.A strong aptitude in algorithms and data structures is essential!\nA desire to write well-documented and maintainable code.\nThe willingness to participate in technical discussions, proposing solutions to technical challenges, participating in code reviews and receiving feedback.\nAn eagerness and curiosity to solve technical problems, trying things out and investigating issues, and supporting the work of others.\nAdditionally, we'd love it if you have this:\nExperience building a rich-text editor.\nExperience working with large, legacy codebases.\nA history of editing on Wikimedia projects.\nA history of open-source contribution.\nBachelor's degree in computer science or mathematics, or equivalent experience.\nWe'd love to hear from you — even if you don't meet 100% of the criteria listed here. Most important is the aptitude to solve hard problems. Algorithms and data structures are extremely important in our products, so if this sounds interesting, come and talk to us!\nAbout the Wikimedia Foundation\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia free knowledge projects. Our vision is a world in which every single human can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.

    "description": "Are you able to write thorough and engaging UX research findings?\nWould you like to join a team of dedicated usability researchers, who produce cutting-edge User Experience research? Producing UX research findings that will be used by thousands of web professionals, including some of the biggest brands in the world (including Amazon, Google, Nike, Shopify)? Are you excellent at presenting complex research findings on web user behavior through the written word?\nThen apply for the remote full-time position as UX Research Analyst & Writer at Baymard Institute.\nAbout Your Job at Baymard\nIn this position, you will join Baymard’s team of usability researchers and primarily work at annotating and analyzing our raw usability test data and writing the insights from this into usability guidelines. The guidelines go directly into our Baymard subscription platform (https://baymard.com/research).\nOur Baymard customers are eagerly waiting for your UX research insights, be it the UI designer at Nike or the ecommerce director at Amazon, as they use it as direct input for their UX and UI design decisions.\nIn this role, you’ll need to enjoy analysis and writing, since analyzing usability test data and writing usability test findings will be at least 50–80% of what you’ll be doing all year round.\nBesides analysis and writing, the job also involves moderating 1-1 usability tests and identifying themes and issues across multiple sites, and coming up with proposals for design patterns that can alleviate the identified problems.\nWhile each researcher at Baymard generally directs their own study, from research design through publication, collaboration with other team members is an essential part of the job. As such, the amount of input and control you have over any one phase of research varies based on the specific research being conducted, other team members’ availability, and your own strengths when it comes to the many phases that comprise a complete research study.\nIn this job, you’ll be directly shaping the future of ecommerce, become a published usability research author, and should expect to join the ranks of the absolute top experts within ecommerce usability within a few years (if you aren’t already).\nWe want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people and, therefore, the position is fully remote. All of Baymard's current research team is already working remotely, and the entire company is structured around remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from locations such as UK, Ireland, EU, Canada, or US.\nFor more information about Baymard as a company, see this “Key Work Values” section (https://baymard.com/jobs/research-writer#key-work-values-at-baymard).\nJob Qualifications\nWhile we will train you in Baymard’s methodology and analysis process, we expect that you have the following qualifications. The numbers in brackets indicate the weighted importance of each on a 7-point scale (higher = more important). These weights reflect how candidates are evaluated, so make sure your application illustrates your prowess in the highest-weighted skills and traits.\n[7/7] Substantial experience with analyzing usability test data. We take qualitative test data in the form of test session videos as the basis for our analysis, so experience in this form of analysis is preferred.\n[7/7] Substantial experience with writing usability guidelines (or best practices, UX issues to avoid, etc.).\n[7/7] A sincere desire to collaborate effectively with colleagues (e.g., by taking in and thoughtfully responding to feedback and editorial direction, supporting other researchers in their own projects, etc.)\n[5/7] Broad experience with usability research (e.g., conducting think-aloud usability test sessions, analyzing data, writing findings).\n[5/7] Ability to propose web design recommendations for the usability issues we identify.\nWe furthermore expect that you are comfortable working remotely via digital platforms. Additionally, as most of our team is either based in the eastern USA or western Europe, you must have at least 3–4 hours of daily scheduled work overlap with those timezones.\nPractical Details\nExperience level: at least 3–5 years of experience in UX research.\nSalary: in accordance with qualifications and location.\nLocation: remote, full-time position from UK, Ireland, EU, Canada, or US.\nStart date: as soon as possible.\nTravel: limited; expect only 0-1 week of optional travel each year (in connection with an optional, company-wide meetup).\nHow to Apply\nIf you’re interested in this position, please send the following:\n1. At least one long-form UX writing sample (1,000+ words), or a series of samples. While a writing sample on a UX topic is strongly preferred, we’ll also consider writing on other web-related topics (e.g., ecommerce, information architecture, documentation). Samples can be both published or unpublished works; all materials are kept confidential. (Note: slide decks and samples with multiple authors are not considered.) (Required)\n2. A cover letter (1 page; PDF) describing how you fit the role and qualifications. (Required)\n3. A resume (PDF) or a link to your LinkedIn profile. (Required)\nSend the above to job+researcher25q2@baymard.com.\n(All applications and materials are treated confidentially.)\nDeadline is May 11th, 2025 (end of day).\nNote: Based on the applications, a few selected candidates will be assigned a paid writing and analysis test, which will be the main evaluation criterion for the position. This will also be a good way for you to get a feel for the primary task of this job. (The test will be performed remotely. You’ll be given a real usability test dataset to analyze and describe within a 10-day deadline.)\nAlso, consider reading our SaaS sales page (https://baymard.com/research) and our “Key Work Values” section (https://baymard.com/jobs/research-writer#key-work-values-at-baymard).\nSincerely,\nEdward Scott, UX Research Lead at the Baymard Institute\nReferral Bonus: If this job isn’t you, but you know someone who’ll be the perfect fit, please send them the link to this page. If we end up hiring the person you referred, we’ll give you a 1 year access to a Baymard ‘Comprehensive’ plan (https://baymard.com/research) (normally $2,388/year).\nJob Type: Full-time\nPay: £40,000.00-£80,000.00 per year\nSchedule:\nMonday to Friday\nApplication Question(s):\nHow many articles have you written on “web-related” subjects in general?\nHow many articles have you written specifically on UX?\nIf any, how many moderated usability test sessions have you conducted?\nExperience:\nProfessional Writing: 2 years (Required)\nWork Location: Remote\nApplication deadline: 11/05/2025",

Our software crushes CO2 and energy costs. Our goal is insanely ambitious, and we’re building a team to match the scale of this challenge. We’ve just raised a Seed round from world-leading investors including Accel (TechCrunch) and we’re growing fast.\nWe make the technology to move energy usage to times when electricity is cheap and green. Our software controls vehicle charging, heating systems, and home batteries. We use machine learning to figure out what energy people will need, and when they'll need it. We control tens of thousands of energy assets, and we’re growing quickly.\nAxle is a unique startup. We’re building in a legacy industry and moving gigawatt-hours of electrons in the real world, but we operate at lightning speed. We ship extraordinarily quickly, and we’re experts in electricity systems. We’re backed by some of the best investors in the world, and we’re growing the team to meet customer demand.\nRead more about what we’re building here.\nRequirements\nAt Axle, we read data from hundreds of thousands of devices every day. We then optimize the performance of those devices, and participate in electricity markets with them. As our business grows, we're looking for a driven data analyst to help build reporting, monitoring, and visualization across the business.\nSome things you might work on:\nVisualizing the charging patterns of thousands of electric vehicles\nBuilding dashboards to help us understand which devices are online\nTracking our financial performance vs our revenue targets\nYou’ll need:\nTech chops: you’ll need comfort with SQL and basic Python knowledge to work with and automate our data processes\nStrong analytical skills: you’ll be speaking MW, kWh, and £ every day\nCommercial instincts: we're looking for somebody who can help us spot opportunities lurking in our data!\nA deep-seated motivation to combat climate change\nComfort moving fast in an uncertain and changeable environment\nYou can expect:\ninsane amounts of ownership\nlots of fascinating data to get to grips with\nthe support of a world class engineering & commercial team\n\nThis role would suit an ambitious generalist with a strong analytical background. We don’t care if you’ve held a role with a similar title before: if you’ve got a track record of getting things done in complex, data-heavy environments, let’s chat.\nInterview process\nInitial interview\nTake-home exercise\nFinal interview (in-person)\nOffer, references, and welcome to the team!\nBenefits\nWe love the idea of fully remote work but it doesn't… work.

We ask that you spend 2-3 days a week in our London office.\nWe are extremely keen to build a diverse company, and we’re particularly eager to hear from candidates who don't fit the traditional role stereotypes.

Would you like to join a team of dedicated usability researchers, who produce cutting-edge User Experience research? Producing UX research findings that will be used by thousands of web professionals, including some of the biggest brands in the world (including Amazon, Google, Nike, Shopify)? Are you excellent at presenting complex research findings on web user behavior through the written word?
Then apply for the remote full-time position as UX Research Analyst & Writer at Baymard Institute.
About Your Job at Baymard
In this position, you will join Baymard’s team of usability researchers and primarily work at annotating and analyzing our raw usability test data and writing the insights from this into usability guidelines. The guidelines go directly into our Baymard subscription platform (https://baymard.com/research).
Our Baymard customers are eagerly waiting for your UX research insights, be it the UI designer at Nike or the ecommerce director at Amazon, as they use it as direct input for their UX and UI design decisions.
In this role, you’ll need to enjoy analysis and writing, since analyzing usability test data and writing usability test findings will be at least 50–80% of what you’ll be doing all year round.
Besides analysis and writing, the job also involves moderating 1-1 usability tests and identifying themes and issues across multiple sites, and coming up with proposals for design patterns that can alleviate the identified problems.
While each researcher at Baymard generally directs their own study, from research design through publication, collaboration with other team members is an essential part of the job. As such, the amount of input and control you have over any one phase of research varies based on the specific research being conducted, other team members’ availability, and your own strengths when it comes to the many phases that comprise a complete research study.
In this job, you’ll be directly shaping the future of ecommerce, become a published usability research author, and should expect to join the ranks of the absolute top experts within ecommerce usability within a few years (if you aren’t already).
We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people and, therefore, the position is fully remote. All of Baymard's current research team is already working remotely, and the entire company is structured around remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from locations such as UK, Ireland, EU, Canada, or US.
For more information about Baymard as a company, see this “Key Work Values” section (https://baymard.com/jobs/research-writer#key-work-values-at-baymard).
Job Qualifications
While we will train you in Baymard’s methodology and analysis process, we expect that you have the following qualifications. The numbers in brackets indicate the weighted importance of each on a 7-point scale (higher = more important). These weights reflect how candidates are evaluated, so make sure your application illustrates your prowess in the highest-weighted skills and traits.
[7/7] Substantial experience with analyzing usability test data. We take qualitative test data in the form of test session videos as the basis for our analysis, so experience in this form of analysis is preferred.
[7/7] Substantial experience with writing usability guidelines (or best practices, UX issues to avoid, etc.).
[7/7] A sincere desire to collaborate effectively with colleagues (e.g., by taking in and thoughtfully responding to feedback and editorial direction, supporting other researchers in their own projects, etc.)
[5/7] Broad experience with usability research (e.g., conducting think-aloud usability test sessions, analyzing data, writing findings).
[5/7] Ability to propose web design recommendations for the usability issues we identify.
We furthermore expect that you are comfortable working remotely via digital platforms. Additionally, as most of our team is either based in the eastern USA or western Europe, you must have at least 3–4 hours of daily scheduled work overlap with those timezones.
Practical Details
Experience level: at least 3–5 years of experience in UX research.
Salary: in accordance with qualifications and location.
Location: remote, full-time position from UK, Ireland, EU, Canada, or US.
Start date: as soon as possible.
Travel: limited; expect only 0-1 week of optional travel each year (in connection with an optional, company-wide meetup).
How to Apply
If you’re interested in this position, please send the following:
1. At least one long-form UX writing sample (1,000+ words), or a series of samples. While a writing sample on a UX topic is strongly preferred, we’ll also consider writing on other web-related topics (e.g., ecommerce, information architecture, documentation). Samples can be both published or unpublished works; all materials are kept confidential. (Note: slide decks and samples with multiple authors are not considered.) (Required)
2. A cover letter (1 page; PDF) describing how you fit the role and qualifications. (Required)
3. A resume (PDF) or a link to your LinkedIn profile. (Required)
Send the above to job+researcher25q2@baymard.com.
(All applications and materials are treated confidentially.)
Deadline is May 11th, 2025 (end of day).
Note: Based on the applications, a few selected candidates will be assigned a paid writing and analysis test, which will be the main evaluation criterion for the position. This will also be a good way for you to get a feel for the primary task of this job. (The test will be performed remotely. You’ll be given a real usability test dataset to analyze and describe within a 10-day deadline.)
Also, consider reading our SaaS sales page (https://baymard.com/research) and our “Key Work Values” section (https://baymard.com/jobs/research-writer#key-work-values-at-baymard).

Ecotricity is Britain's greenest energy company. When we started back in 1995, we were the first company in the world to provide a new kind of electricity - the green kind.
Our mission was, and remains, to change the way energy is made and used in Britain - by replacing fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy.
We don't just supply green energy, we use the money from our customers' bills to make it ourselves too - we build windmills, sun parks and green gasmills in Britain. We call this turning 'bills into mills'. Some of our biggest achievements to date include building Britain's first megawatt windmill and the country's first grid-scale sun park, as well as building our first green gasmill, generating 100% green gas from a source that we will never run out of grass.
We don't just focus on energy though- we built the Electric Highway, Britain's leading network of electric vehicle charging points; we helped Forest Green Rovers become the greenest football club in the world; and we launched Britain's greenest mobile phone service, Ecotalk, where they use the money from their customers' bills to protect and regenerate Britain's lost rainforests.
Ecotricity is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to providing equality for all.
